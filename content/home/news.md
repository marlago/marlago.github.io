      <strong>Interview at Goethe university: </strong>2020 was a challenging year. If you want to hear about the misfortunes of a new professor trying to set up an eye-tracking lab during Corona times, here's my recent interview with UniReport, the magazine of Goethe University (in German) <a target="blank" href=https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/96088517/Interview_Sol_Lago.pdf>[interview]</a>

      <strong>Grant award: </strong>In 2017 I received a grant from the <a target="blank" href="https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/317308350?context=projekt&task=showDetail&id=317308350&">German Research Foundation</a> to study how Spanish and English native speakers process gender and number agreement in German. I am using this research as a test case to address two important questions: <em>Are some languages more difficult to understand and potentially learn than others? And can this difficulty lie in how a speaker's native language shapes their processing mechanisms?</em> This work is being conducted at the University of Potsdam in collaboration with <a target="blank" href="https://stonekate.github.io/">Kate Stone</a> and <a target="blank" href="https://vasishth.github.io/">Shravan Vasishth</a>.
